    <h1>Eggy Car</h1>
    <p>
      Eggy Car is a physics-based driving game created by <strong>Beedo Games</strong>, where your goal is to balance a fragile egg on top of your car while driving across tricky hills, steep valleys, and sudden jumps. 
      Unlike classic racing games that reward speed, Eggy Car emphasizes precision driving, gravity physics, and throttle control.
    </p>

    <p>
      This viral game has attracted millions of players worldwide for its addictive gameplay loop, simple two-button controls, and high-risk, high-reward design. 
      Whether you’re aiming to set a new distance record, climb the leaderboards, or just enjoy a quick session, Eggy Car delivers a fun and challenging experience.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>How to Play Eggy Car</h2>
    <p>
      The controls are simple but mastering the physics is key to success.
    </p>
    <ul class="game-text-list">
      <li><strong>Desktop:</strong> Press <strong>D</strong> or the <strong>right arrow</strong> to accelerate, <strong>A</strong> or the <strong>left arrow</strong> to brake/reverse.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> Tap the right side of the screen to go forward, left side to brake or reverse.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Gameplay: Protect the Egg</h2>
    <p>
      The egg sits loosely on your car’s roof, subject to realistic physics. 
      Drive too fast uphill and it slides backward. Land hard from a jump and it may launch forward. Accelerate aggressively and it could roll off the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your objective is to drive as far as possible while collecting coins and preventing the egg from hitting the ground.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Terrain & Obstacles</h2>
    <ul class="game-text-list">
      <li>Steep hills that launch eggs skyward</li>
      <li>Sudden valleys where momentum threatens stability</li>
      <li>Rolling terrain requiring precise throttle control</li>
      <li>Gaps and jumps demanding smooth landings</li>
      <li>Coins scattered across the route (risk vs. reward)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Every meter traveled counts as progress. Every coin collected without dropping your egg is a calculated risk paid off.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Progression & Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
      Collect coins during runs to unlock:
    </p>
    <ul class="game-text-list">
      <li>New vehicles with improved stability and handling</li>
      <li>Upgrades for smoother driving performance</li>
      <li>Different environments with varied challenge levels</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each run teaches physics, balance, and egg fragility. Every failure brings you closer to the perfect smooth ride.
    </p>

    <br>

    <ul class="game-text-list">
