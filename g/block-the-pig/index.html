    <h1>Block the Pig</h1>
    <p>
      Block the Pig is a fun and challenging puzzle game where your goal is to trap a sneaky pig before it escapes the board.
      Each round begins with the pig placed in the center, and you must strategically place blocks to limit its movement.
      As the game progresses, the difficulty increases, forcing you to think several steps ahead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful — if the pig finds a way out, the game instantly resets and you’ll have to start from the beginning.
      Every move matters, and only smart planning will help you survive the later rounds.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>How to Play Block the Pig</h2>
    <ul class="game-text-list">
      <li>Click on empty tiles to place blocks.</li>
      <li>The pig moves automatically after each block placement.</li>
      <li>Your goal is to completely surround the pig so it cannot escape.</li>
      <li>If the pig reaches the edge of the board, the game resets.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Game Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The objective is to trap the pig in as few moves as possible and complete as many rounds as you can.
      Each new round introduces increased difficulty, requiring better strategy and faster decision-making.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Tips & Strategy</h2>
    <ul class="game-text-list">
      <li>Start blocking paths close to the pig rather than the edges.</li>
      <li>Try to predict the pig’s movement before placing a block.</li>
      <li>Create narrow corridors to limit escape routes.</li>
      <li>Stay calm — rushing often leads to mistakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Why Block the Pig Is Addictive</h2>
    <p>
      Block the Pig combines simple mechanics with deep strategy, making it easy to learn but hard to master.
      The increasing difficulty and instant restarts keep the tension high and encourage players to beat their previous progress.
    </p>
