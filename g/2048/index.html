    <h1>2048</h1>
    <p>
      2048 is a classic single-player mathematical puzzle game that challenges your logic, planning, and patience. 
      The objective is simple yet addictive: merge tiles with the same numbers until you create a tile with the value <strong>2048</strong>.
      Each time two identical tiles collide, they combine into one and double in value.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is played on a compact <strong>4x4 grid</strong>, which means space management is crucial. 
      As the board fills up, every move matters. One wrong slide can block your progress, so planning ahead is the key to success.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>How to Play 2048</h2>
    <p>
      Playing 2048 is easy to learn but hard to master.
    </p>
    <ul class="game-text-list">
      <li>Use your <strong>arrow keys</strong> (up, down, left, right) to slide all tiles in one direction.</li>
      <li>When two tiles with the same number touch, they <strong>merge into one</strong>.</li>
      <li>After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears on the grid.</li>
      <li>The game ends when no more moves are possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Goal of the Game</h2>
    <p>
      The main goal is to create a tile with the number <strong>2048</strong>, but many players continue beyond that to reach 
      even higher numbers like 4096, 8192, or more. There is no hard limit—only your strategy determines how far you can go.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Best Strategy to Win 2048</h2>
    <p>
      While luck plays a small role, smart strategy greatly increases your chances of winning.
    </p>
    <ul class="game-text-list">
      <li>Keep your <strong>highest-value tile in one corner</strong> at all times.</li>
      <li>Try to build tiles in one main direction instead of moving randomly.</li>
      <li>Avoid filling the grid too quickly—always leave free spaces.</li>
      <li>Plan several moves ahead before making a slide.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Why Is 2048 So Addictive?</h2>
    <p>
      2048 combines simple controls with deep strategy, making it enjoyable for both casual players and puzzle lovers.
      Each successful merge feels rewarding, and the constant challenge to beat your previous score keeps players coming back.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Who Created 2048?</h2>
    <p>
      The original 2048 game was created by <strong>Gabriele Cirulli</strong> in 2014.
      It was inspired by the game <strong>1024</strong> by Veewo Studio, which itself was influenced by the popular puzzle game <strong>Threes</strong>.
      The game quickly became a viral hit due to its open-source nature and simple yet engaging gameplay.
    </p>
